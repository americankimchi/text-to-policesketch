# Text-to-Sketch

Drawing a face for a suspect just based on the descriptions of the eyewitnesses is a difficult task. There are some state-of-the-art methods in generating face images from text, but there is still a lot of room for improvement in similarity between input text and generated images. Here, we want to go even further and generate sketches rather than a RGB image.
